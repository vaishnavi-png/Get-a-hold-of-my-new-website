        <h3>2) Fold the paper in half by folding the top corner to the bottom corner. You should have an upside down triangle.</h3>

        <h3>3) Fold part of the top down so that the edge is about halfway down. Don't make this flap too thin because this will become the wings.</h3>

        <h3>4) Turn the paper over, just like so...</h3>

        <h3>9) Push the center of the head in and flatten. This is called an inside reverse fold.</h3>

        <h3>10) And tada! You have yourself a bird. Now set it free! Just kidding. Don't throw it in the air. It will just fall down and you'll be disappointed.</h3>
